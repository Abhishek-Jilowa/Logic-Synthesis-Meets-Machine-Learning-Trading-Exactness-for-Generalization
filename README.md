# Logic-Synthesis-Meets-Machine-Learning-Trading-Exactness-for-Generalization

## Description :
Learn an unknown Boolean function 𝑓 ∶ {0,1}^𝑛 → {0, 1} from a training dataset consisting of input-output pairs. The learned function should be in the form of And-Inverter Graph (AIG) with strict hardware cost (≤ 5000 gates), and will be evaluated by its prediction accuracy in hidden testing dataset.

## Benchmarks:
Each benchmark is provided in PLA format and contains minterms in training, validation and testing set.

## Steps:
To run the code follow the steps below :
1) Open the colab and provide the dataset which you are using.
2) Make sure 1st row of data contains column numbers not the actual data.
3) Run the code and SOP and boolean structure can be obtained.
